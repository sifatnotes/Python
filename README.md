Welcome to my Python repository!

This repository contains various Python scripts and projects that I have worked on over the past month. The goal of this repository is to showcase my skills and knowledge in the Python programming language.

You will find a variety of scripts that demonstrate my proficiency in different aspects of Python, such as data analysis, web scraping, and machine learning. All of the code is well-commented and easy to understand.

To run any of the scripts, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Simply clone or download the repository and navigate to the directory where the script is located in your command prompt or terminal. Then type "python scriptname.py" to run the script.

I will be continually updating this repository with new projects and scripts, so feel free to check back often. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. Thanks for visiting!
